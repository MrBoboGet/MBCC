# MBCC

MBCC is a parser generator that supports linear approximate LL(k) grammars, and
currently only supports C++ as target language. It is designed with the goal of
minimizing the amount of semantic actions needed to construct an AST, and with
features to make it convenient to implement an LSP server on the resulting AST.
